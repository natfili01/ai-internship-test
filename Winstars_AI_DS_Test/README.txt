# AI Internship Test

**Winstars AI DS Internship Test 2025.**  
This project includes two tasks covering Computer Vision and NLP pipelines.

1. **Task 1**: MNIST classification with three different models (Random Forest, Feed-Forward Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network).  
2. **Task 2**: Named Entity Recognition for detecting animals in text, and an image classification model for validating if the text matches the content of the image.

## Repository Structure

ai-internship-test/ ├─ Winstars_AI_DS_Test/ │ ├─ Task_1/ │ └─ Task_2/ (to be added) └─ README.md <-- you are here


- **Task_1**:  
  Contains all scripts, models, and notebooks related to the MNIST classification problem.  

- **Task_2** *(not yet added / coming soon)*:  
  Will contain the NER and image classification solution for the second task.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/natfili01/ai-internship-test.git


2. **Install the required libraries for each task. For example, in Task 1:
   ''' bash
   cd ai-internship-test/Winstars_AI_DS_Test/Task_1
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts as specified in each task’s readme file.

Usage

    Task_1 (MNIST):
        Open Task_1/README.md for detailed instructions.
        Use the provided .py scripts or the Jupyter notebook to train and evaluate models.

    Task_2 (NLP + CV):
        Once added, refer to Task_2/README.md.
